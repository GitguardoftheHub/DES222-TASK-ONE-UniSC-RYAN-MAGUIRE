                            Having citizens integrated into the functions of the city allows easier access to transportation, high-quality education and healthcare services (Amine, 2023). This also allows the government to work efficiently (Amine, 2023). Figure 1 Vehicles travelling down the road Note.

                            Rarely discussed is the platform that Smart Cities provide for authoritarian regimes. To construct these Smart Cities, the government will need to contract the major IT companies to provide the needed hardware and software, as well as the control services for the networks. The IT companies that construct these cities therefore gain monopolies over them, and the government becomes reliant on this new corporatocracy.

                            For the corporatocracy, the city becomes a tool of domination in the market (Tomin, 2021). The interconnected network becomes a means for them to extract and analyse citizens’ data (Tomin, 2021), allowing them to exploit personal weaknesses and cognitive biases with calculated efficiency and unprecedented effectiveness (Christl, 2017).

                          If any citizen acts out of line with Orwellian laws, the corporatocracy can completely shut out those ‘dissenters’ from the city network. This deprives them of water, power, food, and medical services.

                           Precedent for this was set during the Cold War in Brazil. The US was instrumental in the 1964 coup, which was supported also by Brazilian economic elites concerned with then-President  João left-leaning initiatives. (Cavalcanti & Garmany, 2020) To get around the public’s turn against these regimes in the 60s, foreign police training to combat terrorism was reinstated by the US in the mid-1980s (Cavalcanti & Garmany, 2020). Ultimately, privatised programs allowed US police assistance to re-emerge  in the 1980s and 1990s (Cavalcanti & Garmany, 2020).

                            The corporatocracy will also construct both predictive policing algorithms and economic algorithms, and then manipulate these two algorithms as a method of social control.

                            The areas that the corporatocracy believe are sympathetic to ‘dissent’ will see the policing algorithm deployed, whereas those areas that are seen as loyal and important to the regime will be rewarded with the economic algorithm. Essentially, this leads to spatial inequality across racial and social classes (Brannon, 2017).
